          TEXT2FVF -- AN INTRODUCTION

'text2fvf' is a program with converts large matrices of 
real numbers into simple binary format ('fastvector', or
FVF, format). The 'fastvector' library was primarily 
designed to facilitate analysis of genome-wide 
association and other large-scale genetic studies. In 
such studies, the amount of the data to go through may 
be huge (here we are talking about terabytes) and 
storage of these data in RAM is not quite possible. 
FVF-format and associated library provides fast access
to the data.


          TEXT2FVF -- A SHORT TUTORIAL

Here I will explain some uses of text2fvf to convert outputs of 
MACH and IMPUTE to FVF format. Call 'text2fvf' without any arguments 
to see basic help.

Assume that MACH 'mldose' file you need to convert is named 
'merlin.21.collected.ped.out.mldose'. This file contains 
subjects IDs as the first column, and as the second column 
it contains a constant record 'MLDOSE'. No header line is 
available.

To make simple conversion, use

text2fvf -i merlin.21.collected.ped.out.mldose \
         -o merlin.21.collected.ped.out.mldose.fvf \
				 -s 2 -r 1

However, it is derirable to have SNP names recorded in FVF-file. 
To do that, you first need to arrange a file containing the SNP
names. If the corrsponding 'info' file is named 
'merlin.21.collected.ped.out.mlinf', you can use standard 
*NIX commands to get a file with SNP list with

cat merlin.21.collected.ped.out.mlinfo | awk '{print $1}' | \
				grep -v "^SNP$"  > merlin.21.collected.ped.out.snplist

(do not use '\' here, copy on a single line if needed!)

Then you can use 'text2fvf' with supplying the column names:

text2fvf -i merlin.21.collected.ped.out.mldose \
				 -o merlin.21.collected.ped.out.mldose.tfvf \
 				 --colnames=merlin.21.collected.ped.out.snplist \
				 -s 2 -r 1

If you want to convert 'mlprob' file, this is not a problem,
except that as two columns are supplied per SNP, you need to 
generate a separate SNP-names file with two names per SNP:

cat merlin.21.collected.ped.out.mlinfo | \
				 awk '{print $1"_pBB\n"$1"_pBA"}' | \
				 grep -v "^SNP_p"  > \
				 merlin.21.collected.ped.out.2snplist



Conversion of IMPUTE format: quite the same, but use '-t' 
option as IMPUTE stores the data in raw-per-SNP format. 
Consecutively column names are th IDs of the subjects.
Also mind three probabilities are stored in the IMPUTE format.

Good luck with number-crunching!
